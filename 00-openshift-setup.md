# Environment Setup for OpenShift-based Labs

In order to try out the labs that runs on top of Openshift 4, you need to have an OpenShift cluster. You can either use an existing cluster or bootstrap one in your own environment. 

You should also have an oc client installed in your machine if you want to access the OpenShift cluster via [command line](https://developers.redhat.com/openshift/command-line-tools/). Make sure you have the `oc client` that is compatible with your OpenShift version.
