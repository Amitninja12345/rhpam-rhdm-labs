Import Assets Lab
=================

In the previous lab, you created the greeting decision logic for the `customer-greeting` project. In this lab, you create the decision logic to display the salutation (or personâ€™s title):

As you can see in the definition diagram, to choose the correct salutation (or title) for the customer greeting, information about the customer is required, such as gender and marital status. In this lab, you import all of the appropriate assets from the existing [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/dm7-customer-greeting).

## Goals

-   Import data objects into an existing project

-   Import decision tables into an existing project

-   Import test scenarios into an existing project

-   Deploy a tested project to Decision Server

-   Test the deployed project using a web application

## Pre-reqs

-   Successful completion of the 02-1-*Create Project Lab*

-   Successful login to Decision Central

-   A `Determine Greeting` decision table in the `customer-greeting` project
